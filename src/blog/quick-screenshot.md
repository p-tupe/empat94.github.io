Heyo, quick tip - While web-browsing, should you ever need to take a screenshot of any page, you don't need to install any fancy extensions to do so.

Just follow the steps below (these are for Chrome and other chromium-based browsers):

  1. Open Developer Tools
  2. Run Command (using shortcut or from 3-dot menu)
  3. Type "screensh"
  4. Select relevant option (btw, full size = scrolling shot)
  5. Done

  I'm pretty sure there are ways to do the same on all major browsers, although I haven't tried any. If you know, do comment the same and I'll add it to the post (with due credits, of course). That is all! I did say "quick" tip, didn't I? Cheers.
